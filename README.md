# Card Editor
This is my repository for my capstone project.

The project is intended to be a webpage that allows users to log in, create, and customize their own baseball cards using a template.

## Setup
Once cloned, you will need to install dependencies by typing `npm i` into the terminal. After, you should create a **.env** file in the root directory that contains both the text *SECRET=secret* and *DATABASE="insert your database connection string here"*. One this is done, you should be able to type *npm start* and run the project from inside your browser at **port 3000**.

## Usage
One the project is setup, you will need to create a user and log in to the site. Once done, you can then customize your cards to your liking and even insert statistics into the database in order to reference the data at a later time.

When you're done editing your cards and inserting your statistics data, all you need to do is take a screenshot and crop it to fit the size of the cards. Then you are free to do as you wish with the cards that you created!
