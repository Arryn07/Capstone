# Card Editor
This is my repository for my capstone project.

The project is intended to be a webpage that allows users to log in, create, and customize their own baseball cards using a template.

## Setup
Once cloned, you will need to install dependencies by typing *npm i* into the terminal. After, you should create a **.env** file in the root directory that contains both the text *SECRET=secret* and *DATABASE="insert your database connection string here"*. One this is done, you should be able to type *npm start* and run the project from inside your browser at **port 3000**.
